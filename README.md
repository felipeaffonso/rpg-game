##RPG Game - The Coffee Journey ##

At this game, you are a Software Developer that is trying to do what we do every day: Drink Coffee!
You can choose your Programming Language, but you have to think with your brain, not with your heart S2!

Here is the dynamics:

You are now at your desk with Slack window opened and with a lot of notifications blinking!
Each slack message could have a good or bad surprise, that guides you in our path to **Coffee Nirvana**, when you everything become shiny and clear (this is the end of the game).
But... I don't think only good thinks are going to happen! You will need to correct a lot of bugs and solve a lot of problems too.

I wish you good luck!
